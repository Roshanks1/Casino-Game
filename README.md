# Casino-Game

This is a dice game where you start with a specified amount of money (stake)
You can bet for every turn
When you roll the dice a number of outcomes may occur:
If at first you roll a 7 or 11 you automatically win 
If at first you roll a 2, 3, or 12 you instantly lose

Otherwise the other sums will become a "point"
You roll again and if you roll the point you win
But if you roll a 7, this time you lose
